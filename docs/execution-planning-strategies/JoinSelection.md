# JoinSelection Execution Planning Strategy

`JoinSelection` is an [execution planning strategy](SparkStrategy.md) that [SparkPlanner](../SparkPlanner.md) uses to <<apply, plan a Join logical operator to one of the supported join physical operators>> (as described by <<join-selection-requirements, join physical operator selection requirements>>).

`JoinSelection` firstly <<apply, considers>> join physical operators per whether join keys are used or not. When join keys are used, `JoinSelection` considers <<BroadcastHashJoinExec, BroadcastHashJoinExec>>, <<ShuffledHashJoinExec, ShuffledHashJoinExec>> or <<SortMergeJoinExec, SortMergeJoinExec>> operators. Without join keys, `JoinSelection` considers <<BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec, BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec>> or <<CartesianProductExec, CartesianProductExec>>.

NOTE: `JoinSelection` uses spark-sql-ExtractEquiJoinKeys.md[ExtractEquiJoinKeys] Scala extractor to destructure a `Join` logical operator.

=== [[muchSmaller]] Is Left-Side Plan At Least 3 Times Smaller Than Right-Side Plan? -- `muchSmaller` Internal Condition

[source, scala]
----
muchSmaller(a: LogicalPlan, b: LogicalPlan): Boolean
----

`muchSmaller` condition holds when plan `a` is at least 3 times smaller than plan `b`.

Internally, `muchSmaller` spark-sql-LogicalPlan.md#stats[calculates the estimated statistics for the input logical plans] and compares their physical size in bytes (`sizeInBytes`).

NOTE: `muchSmaller` is used when `JoinSelection` checks <<join-selection-requirements, join selection requirements>> for `ShuffledHashJoinExec` physical operator.

=== [[canBuildLocalHashMap]] `canBuildLocalHashMap` Internal Condition

[source, scala]
----
canBuildLocalHashMap(plan: LogicalPlan): Boolean
----

`canBuildLocalHashMap` condition holds for the logical `plan` whose single partition is small enough to build a hash table (i.e. [spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold](../configuration-properties.md#spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold) multiplied by [spark.sql.shuffle.partitions](../configuration-properties.md#spark.sql.shuffle.partitions)).

Internally, `canBuildLocalHashMap` spark-sql-LogicalPlan.md#stats[calculates the estimated statistics for the input logical plans] and takes the size in bytes (`sizeInBytes`).

NOTE: `canBuildLocalHashMap` is used when `JoinSelection` checks <<join-selection-requirements, join selection requirements>> for `ShuffledHashJoinExec` physical operator.

=== [[canBroadcast]] Can Logical Plan Be Broadcast? -- `canBroadcast` Internal Condition

[source, scala]
----
canBroadcast(plan: LogicalPlan): Boolean
----

`canBroadcast` is enabled (`true`) when the size of the output of the input logical plan (aka _sizeInBytes_) is less than [spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold](../configuration-properties.md#spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold) configuration property.

`canBroadcast` uses the total size statistic from [Statistics](../logical-operators/LogicalPlanStats.md#stats) of a logical operator.

`canBroadcast` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to [canBroadcastBySizes](#canBroadcastBySizes) and [selects the build side per join type and total size statistic of join sides](#broadcastSideBySizes).

=== [[canBroadcastByHints]] `canBroadcastByHints` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
canBroadcastByHints(joinType: JoinType, left: LogicalPlan, right: LogicalPlan): Boolean
----

`canBroadcastByHints` is positive (i.e. `true`) when either condition holds:

. Join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER] or spark-sql-joins.md#RIGHT_OUTER[RIGHT OUTER] (i.e. <<canBuildLeft, canBuildLeft>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and `left` operator's [broadcast](../logical-operators/HintInfo.md#broadcast) hint flag is on

. Join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_ANTI[LEFT ANTI], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_OUTER[LEFT OUTER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_SEMI[LEFT SEMI] or spark-sql-joins.md#ExistenceJoin[ExistenceJoin] (i.e. <<canBuildRight, canBuildRight>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and `right` operator's [broadcast](../logical-operators/HintInfo.md#broadcast) hint flag is on

Otherwise, `canBroadcastByHints` is negative (i.e. `false`).

NOTE: `canBroadcastByHints` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<apply, plan a Join logical operator>> (and considers a BroadcastHashJoinExec.md[BroadcastHashJoinExec] or a BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.md[BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec] physical operator).

=== [[broadcastSideByHints]] Selecting Build Side Per Join Type and Broadcast Hints -- `broadcastSideByHints` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
broadcastSideByHints(joinType: JoinType, left: LogicalPlan, right: LogicalPlan): BuildSide
----

`broadcastSideByHints` computes `buildLeft` and `buildRight` flags:

* `buildLeft` flag is positive (i.e. `true`) when the join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER] or spark-sql-joins.md#RIGHT_OUTER[RIGHT OUTER] (i.e. <<canBuildLeft, canBuildLeft>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and the `left` operator's [broadcast](../logical-operators/HintInfo.md#broadcast) hint flag is positive

* `buildRight` flag is positive (i.e. `true`) when the join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_ANTI[LEFT ANTI], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_OUTER[LEFT OUTER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_SEMI[LEFT SEMI] or spark-sql-joins.md#ExistenceJoin[ExistenceJoin] (i.e. <<canBuildRight, canBuildRight>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and the `right` operator's [broadcast](../logical-operators/HintInfo.md#broadcast) hint flag is positive

In the end, `broadcastSideByHints` <<broadcastSide, gives the join side to broadcast>>.

NOTE: `broadcastSideByHints` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<apply, plan a Join logical operator>> (and considers a BroadcastHashJoinExec.md[BroadcastHashJoinExec] or a BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.md[BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec] physical operator).

=== [[broadcastSide]] Choosing Join Side to Broadcast -- `broadcastSide` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
broadcastSide(
  canBuildLeft: Boolean,
  canBuildRight: Boolean,
  left: LogicalPlan,
  right: LogicalPlan): BuildSide
----

`broadcastSide` gives the smaller side (`BuildRight` or `BuildLeft`) per [total size](../logical-operators/Statistics.md#sizeInBytes) when `canBuildLeft` and `canBuildRight` are both positive (i.e. `true`).

`broadcastSide` gives `BuildRight` when `canBuildRight` is positive.

`broadcastSide` gives `BuildLeft` when `canBuildLeft` is positive.

When all the above conditions are not met, `broadcastSide` gives the smaller side (`BuildRight` or `BuildLeft`) per [total size](../logical-operators/Statistics.md#sizeInBytes) (similarly to the first case when `canBuildLeft` and `canBuildRight` are both positive).

NOTE: `broadcastSide` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<broadcastSideByHints, broadcastSideByHints>>, <<broadcastSideBySizes, select the build side per join type and total size statistic of join sides>>, and <<apply, execute>> (and considers a BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.md[BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec] physical operator).

=== [[canBuildLeft]] Checking If Join Type Allows For Left Join Side As Build Side -- `canBuildLeft` Internal Condition

[source, scala]
----
canBuildLeft(joinType: JoinType): Boolean
----

`canBuildLeft` is positive (i.e. `true`) for spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER] and spark-sql-joins.md#RIGHT_OUTER[RIGHT OUTER] join types. Otherwise, `canBuildLeft` is negative (i.e. `false`).

NOTE: `canBuildLeft` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<canBroadcastByHints, canBroadcastByHints>>, <<broadcastSideByHints, broadcastSideByHints>>, <<canBroadcastBySizes, canBroadcastBySizes>>, <<broadcastSideBySizes, broadcastSideBySizes>> and <<apply, execute>> (when selecting a <<ShuffledHashJoinExec>> physical operator).

=== [[canBuildRight]] Checking If Join Type Allows For Right Join Side As Build Side -- `canBuildRight` Internal Condition

[source, scala]
----
canBuildRight(joinType: JoinType): Boolean
----

`canBuildRight` is positive (i.e. `true`) if the input join type is one of the following:

* spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_ANTI[LEFT ANTI], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_OUTER[LEFT OUTER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_SEMI[LEFT SEMI] or spark-sql-joins.md#ExistenceJoin[ExistenceJoin]

Otherwise, `canBuildRight` is negative (i.e. `false`).

NOTE: `canBuildRight` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<canBroadcastByHints, canBroadcastByHints>>, <<broadcastSideByHints, broadcastSideByHints>>, <<canBroadcastBySizes, canBroadcastBySizes>>, <<broadcastSideBySizes, broadcastSideBySizes>> and <<apply, execute>> (when selecting a <<ShuffledHashJoinExec>> physical operator).

=== [[canBroadcastBySizes]] Checking If Join Type and Total Size Statistic of Join Sides Allow for Broadcast Join -- `canBroadcastBySizes` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
canBroadcastBySizes(joinType: JoinType, left: LogicalPlan, right: LogicalPlan): Boolean
----

`canBroadcastBySizes` is positive (i.e. `true`) when either condition holds:

. Join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER] or spark-sql-joins.md#RIGHT_OUTER[RIGHT OUTER] (i.e. <<canBuildLeft, canBuildLeft>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and `left` operator <<canBroadcast, can be broadcast per total size statistic>>

. Join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_ANTI[LEFT ANTI], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_OUTER[LEFT OUTER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_SEMI[LEFT SEMI] or spark-sql-joins.md#ExistenceJoin[ExistenceJoin] (i.e. <<canBuildRight, canBuildRight>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and `right` operator <<canBroadcast, can be broadcast per total size statistic>>

Otherwise, `canBroadcastByHints` is negative (i.e. `false`).

NOTE: `canBroadcastByHints` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<apply, plan a Join logical operator>> (and considers a BroadcastHashJoinExec.md[BroadcastHashJoinExec] or a BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.md[BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec] physical operator).

=== [[broadcastSideBySizes]] Selecting Build Side Per Join Type and Total Size Statistic of Join Sides -- `broadcastSideBySizes` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
broadcastSideBySizes(joinType: JoinType, left: LogicalPlan, right: LogicalPlan): BuildSide
----

`broadcastSideBySizes` computes `buildLeft` and `buildRight` flags:

* `buildLeft` flag is positive (i.e. `true`) when the join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER] or spark-sql-joins.md#RIGHT_OUTER[RIGHT OUTER] (i.e. <<canBuildLeft, canBuildLeft>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and `left` operator <<canBroadcast, can be broadcast per total size statistic>>

* `buildRight` flag is positive (i.e. `true`) when the join type is spark-sql-joins.md#CROSS[CROSS], spark-sql-joins.md#INNER[INNER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_ANTI[LEFT ANTI], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_OUTER[LEFT OUTER], spark-sql-joins.md#LEFT_SEMI[LEFT SEMI] or spark-sql-joins.md#ExistenceJoin[ExistenceJoin] (i.e. <<canBuildRight, canBuildRight>> for the input `joinType` is positive) and `right` operator <<canBroadcast, can be broadcast per total size statistic>>

In the end, `broadcastSideByHints` <<broadcastSide, gives the join side to broadcast>>.

NOTE: `broadcastSideByHints` is used when `JoinSelection` is requested to <<apply, plan a Join logical operator>> (and considers a BroadcastHashJoinExec.md[BroadcastHashJoinExec] or a BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.md[BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec] physical operator).

=== [[apply]] Applying JoinSelection Strategy to Logical Plan (Executing JoinSelection) -- `apply` Method

[source, scala]
----
apply(plan: LogicalPlan): Seq[SparkPlan]
----

`apply` is part of [GenericStrategy](../catalyst/GenericStrategy.md#apply) abstraction.

`apply` uses spark-sql-ExtractEquiJoinKeys.md[ExtractEquiJoinKeys] Scala extractor to destructure the input logical `plan`.

==== [[apply-BroadcastHashJoinExec]] Considering BroadcastHashJoinExec Physical Operator

`apply` gives a BroadcastHashJoinExec.md#creating-instance[BroadcastHashJoinExec] physical operator if the plan <<canBroadcastByHints, should be broadcast per join type and broadcast hints used>> (for the join type and left or right side of the join). `apply` <<broadcastSideByHints, selects the build side per join type and broadcast hints>>.

`apply` gives a BroadcastHashJoinExec.md#creating-instance[BroadcastHashJoinExec] physical operator if the plan <<canBroadcastBySizes, should be broadcast per join type and size of join sides>> (for the join type and left or right side of the join). `apply` <<broadcastSideBySizes, selects the build side per join type and total size statistic of join sides>>.
