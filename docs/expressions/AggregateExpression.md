# AggregateExpression

`AggregateExpression` is an [unevaluable expression](Unevaluable.md) that acts as a container for an [AggregateFunction](#aggregateFunction).

## Creating Instance

`AggregateExpression` takes the following to be created:

* <span id="aggregateFunction"> [AggregateFunction](AggregateFunction.md)
* <span id="mode"> `AggregateMode`
* <span id="isDistinct"> `isDistinct` flag
* <span id="filter"> (optional) Filter [Expression](Expression.md)
* <span id="resultId"> Result `ExprId`

`AggregateExpression` is createdÂ using [apply](#apply) utility.

## <span id="apply"> Creating AggregateExpression

```scala
apply(
  aggregateFunction: AggregateFunction,
  mode: AggregateMode,
  isDistinct: Boolean,
  filter: Option[Expression] = None): AggregateExpression
```

`apply` creates an [AggregateExpression](#creating-instance) with a new autogenerated `ExprId`.

`apply` is used when:

* `AggregateFunction` is requested to [toAggregateExpression](AggregateFunction.md#toAggregateExpression)
* _others_

## <span id="toString"> Human-Friendly Textual Representation

```scala
toString: String
```

`toString` returns the following text:

```text
[prefix][name]([args]) FILTER (WHERE [predicate])
```

`toString` converts the [mode](#mode) to a prefix.

mode | prefix
-----|----------
 `Partial` | `partial_`
 `PartialMerge` | `merge_`
 `Final` or `Complete` | (empty)

`toString` requests the [AggregateFunction](#aggregateFunction) for the [toAggString](AggregateFunction.md#toAggString) (with the [isDistinct](#isDistinct) flag).

In the end, `toString` adds `FILTER (WHERE [predicate])` based on the optional [filter](#filter) expression.

## Review Me

`AggregateExpression` contains the following:

* [[aggregateFunction]] [AggregateFunction](AggregateFunction.md)
* [[mode]] `AggregateMode`
* [[isDistinct]] `isDistinct` flag indicating whether this aggregation is distinct or not (e.g. whether SQL's `DISTINCT` keyword was used for the [aggregate function](#aggregateFunction))
* [[resultId]] `ExprId`

`AggregateExpression` is created when:

* `Analyzer` is requested to [resolve AggregateFunctions](../Analyzer.md#ResolveFunctions) (and creates an `AggregateExpression` with `Complete` aggregate mode for the functions)

* `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` is created with `isDistinct` flag [disabled](../UserDefinedAggregateFunction.md#apply) or [enabled](../UserDefinedAggregateFunction.md#distinct)

* `AggUtils` is requested to [planAggregateWithOneDistinct](../AggUtils.md#planAggregateWithOneDistinct) (and creates `AggregateExpressions` with `Partial` and `Final` aggregate modes for the functions)

* `Aggregator` is requested for a [TypedColumn](../TypedColumn.md) (using `Aggregator.toColumn`)

* `AggregateFunction` is spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.md#toAggregateExpression[wrapped in a AggregateExpression]

| Name
| Description

| `canonicalized`
| `AggregateExpression` with <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> expression `canonicalized` with the special `ExprId` as `0`.

| `children`
| <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> expression (for which `AggregateExpression` was created).

| `dataType`
| [DataType](../types/DataType.md) of [AggregateFunction](#aggregateFunction) expression

| Disabled (i.e. `false`)

| `nullable`
| Whether or not <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> expression is nullable.

| [[references]] `references`
a| `AttributeSet` with the following:

* `references` of <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> when <<mode, AggregateMode>> is `Partial` or `Complete`

* spark-sql-Expression-AggregateFunction.md#aggBufferAttributes[aggBufferAttributes] of <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> when `PartialMerge` or `Final`

| `resultAttribute`
a|

spark-sql-Expression-Attribute.md[Attribute] that is:

* `AttributeReference` when <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> is itself resolved

* `UnresolvedAttribute` otherwise

| `sql`
| Requests <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>> to generate SQL output (with <<isDistinct, isDistinct>> flag).

| `toString`
| <<toString-prefixes, Prefix per AggregateMode>> followed by <<aggregateFunction, AggregateFunction>>'s `toAggString` (with <<isDistinct, isDistinct>> flag).
