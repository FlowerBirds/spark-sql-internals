# AggregateExpression

`AggregateExpression` is an [unevaluable expression](Unevaluable.md) that acts as a container (_wrapper_) for an [AggregateFunction](#aggregateFunction).

## Creating Instance

`AggregateExpression` takes the following to be created:

* <span id="aggregateFunction"> [AggregateFunction](AggregateFunction.md)
* [AggregateMode](#mode)
* <span id="isDistinct"> `isDistinct` flag
* [Aggregate Filter](#filter)
* <span id="resultId"> Result `ExprId`

`AggregateExpression` is created using [apply](#apply) utility.

### <span id="filter"> Aggregate Filter

`AggregateExpression` can be given an [Expression](Expression.md) for an aggregate filter.

The filter is assumed undefined by default when `AggregateExpression` is [created](#apply).

A filter is used in [Partial](#Partial) and [Complete](#Complete) modes only (cf. [AggUtils](../AggUtils.md#mayRemoveAggFilters)).

`AggregationIterator` initializes predicates with `AggregateExpression`s with filters when requested to [generateProcessRow](../aggregations/AggregationIterator.md#generateProcessRow).

## <span id="mode"> AggregateMode

`AggregateExpression` is given an `AggregateMode` when [created](#creating-instance).

* For `PartialMerge` or `Final` modes, the input to the [AggregateFunction](#aggregateFunction) is [immutable input aggregation buffers](AggregateFunction.md#inputAggBufferAttributes), and the actual children of the `AggregateFunction` are not used

* [AggregateExpression](../aggregations/AggregationIterator.md#aggregateExpressions)s of an [AggregationIterator](../aggregations/AggregationIterator.md) cannot have more than 2 distinct modes nor the modes be among `Partial` and `PartialMerge` or `Final` and `Complete` mode pairs

* `Partial` and `Complete` or `PartialMerge` and `Final` pairs are supported

### <span id="Complete"> Complete

No prefix (in [toString](#toString))

Used when:

* `ObjectAggregationIterator` is requested for the [mergeAggregationBuffers](../aggregations/ObjectAggregationIterator.md#mergeAggregationBuffers)
* `TungstenAggregationIterator` is requested for the [switchToSortBasedAggregation](../aggregations/TungstenAggregationIterator.md#switchToSortBasedAggregation)
* _others_

### <span id="Final"> Final

No prefix (in [toString](#toString))

### <span id="Partial"> Partial

* Partial aggregation
* `partial_` prefix (in [toString](#toString))

### <span id="PartialMerge"> PartialMerge

* `merge_` prefix (in [toString](#toString))

## <span id="apply"> Creating AggregateExpression

```scala
apply(
  aggregateFunction: AggregateFunction,
  mode: AggregateMode,
  isDistinct: Boolean,
  filter: Option[Expression] = None): AggregateExpression
```

`apply` creates an [AggregateExpression](#creating-instance) with a new autogenerated `ExprId`.

`apply` is used when:

* `AggregateFunction` is requested to [toAggregateExpression](AggregateFunction.md#toAggregateExpression)
* _others_

## <span id="toString"> Human-Friendly Textual Representation

```scala
toString: String
```

`toString` returns the following text:

```text
[prefix][name]([args]) FILTER (WHERE [predicate])
```

`toString` converts the [mode](#mode) to a prefix.

mode | prefix
-----|----------
 [Partial](#Partial) | `partial_`
 [PartialMerge](#PartialMerge) | `merge_`
 [Final](#Final) or [Complete](#Complete) | (empty)

`toString` requests the [AggregateFunction](#aggregateFunction) for the [toAggString](AggregateFunction.md#toAggString) (with the [isDistinct](#isDistinct) flag).

In the end, `toString` adds `FILTER (WHERE [predicate])` based on the optional [filter](#filter) expression.
