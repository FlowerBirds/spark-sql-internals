# Connectors (Data Sources)

The following are some of the built-in connectors (_data sources_) in Spark SQL based on the modern [Connector API](../connector/index.md) for various data formats and storages:

* [kafka](../kafka/index.md)
* [parquet](../parquet/index.md)
* _others_ (see the menu on the left)
