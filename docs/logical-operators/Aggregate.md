# Aggregate Unary Logical Operator

`Aggregate` is a [unary logical operator](LogicalPlan.md#UnaryNode) that holds the following:

* [[groupingExpressions]] Grouping [expressions](../expressions/Expression.md)
* [[aggregateExpressions]] Aggregate [named expressions](../expressions/NamedExpression.md)
* [[child]] Child [logical operator](LogicalPlan.md)

`Aggregate` is created to represent the following (after a logical plan is [analyzed](LogicalPlan.md#analyzed)):

* SQL's spark-sql-AstBuilder.md#withAggregation[GROUP BY] clause (possibly with `WITH CUBE` or `WITH ROLLUP`)

* spark-sql-RelationalGroupedDataset.md[RelationalGroupedDataset] aggregations (e.g. spark-sql-RelationalGroupedDataset.md#pivot[pivot])

* spark-sql-KeyValueGroupedDataset.md[KeyValueGroupedDataset] aggregations

* AnalyzeColumnCommand.md[AnalyzeColumnCommand] logical command

NOTE: `Aggregate` logical operator is translated to one of [HashAggregateExec](../physical-operators/HashAggregateExec.md), [ObjectHashAggregateExec](../physical-operators/ObjectHashAggregateExec.md) or [SortAggregateExec](../physical-operators/SortAggregateExec.md) physical operators in [Aggregation](../execution-planning-strategies/Aggregation.md) execution planning strategy.

| Name
| Description

| `maxRows`
a| <<child, Child logical plan>>'s `maxRows`

NOTE: Part of spark-sql-LogicalPlan.md#maxRows[LogicalPlan contract].

| `output`
a| Attributes of <<aggregateExpressions, aggregate named expressions>>

NOTE: Part of catalyst/QueryPlan.md#output[QueryPlan contract].

| `resolved`
a| Enabled when:

* <<expressions, expressions>> and <<child, child logical plan>> are resolved
* No spark-sql-Expression-WindowExpression.md[WindowExpressions] exist in <<aggregateExpressions, aggregate named expressions>>

NOTE: Part of spark-sql-LogicalPlan.md#resolved[LogicalPlan contract].

| `validConstraints`
a| The (expression) constraints of <<child, child logical plan>> and non-aggregate <<aggregateExpressions, aggregate named expressions>>.

NOTE: Part of catalyst/QueryPlan.md#validConstraints[QueryPlan contract].

=== [[optimizer]] Rule-Based Logical Query Optimization Phase

PushDownPredicate.md[PushDownPredicate] logical plan optimization applies so-called *filter pushdown* to a Pivot.md[Pivot] operator when under `Filter` operator and with all expressions deterministic.
